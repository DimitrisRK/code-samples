# NativeScript Code Samples

This repository contains a collection of code samples showcasing typical functions required of a cross-platform mobile app built with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/).

These code samples will be made available on the [NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/) üè™ and many of them run as-is in the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/) ü§∏.

## Prerequisites
