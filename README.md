# NativeScript Code Samples

This repository contains a collection of code samples showcasing typical functions required of a cross-platform mobile app built with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/).

These code samples will be made available on the [NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/) and many of them run as-is in the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/).

## Prerequisites

If you are new to NativeScript, the best place to start is by following our getting started tutorials for either [JavaScript](http://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/chapter-0) or [Angular](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0). If you're a Vue.js developer, you may want to look at the [NativeScript-Vue quick start](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/introduction/).
